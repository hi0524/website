 <h2>DEATH METAL </h2>
    <p>
        Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. <br>
        It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking; deep growling vocals; aggressive, powerful drumming, featuring double kick and blast beat techniques; <br>
        minor keys or atonality; abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes; and chromatic chord progressions. <br>
        The lyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence, political conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, true crime and science fiction. <br>
        Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s.<br>
        Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's creation.<br>
         Possessed, Death, Necrophagia, Obituary, Autopsy, and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre. <br>
         In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as a popular genre. <br>
         Niche record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate. <br>

<h2>BLACK METAL</h2>
<p>
    Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. 
    Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style,heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording,
    unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere.
    Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.
    During the 1980s, several thrash metal and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal.
    This "first wave" included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost.
    A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon and Gorgoroth. 
    The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. 
    Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently. 
    Some prominent Swedish bands spawned during this second wave, the second generation in Sweden being led by Dissection, Abruptum, Marduk,nd Nifelheim.
    Initially a synonym for "Satanic metal", black metal has often sparked controversy, due to the actions and ideologies associated with the genre. 
    Some artists express misanthropic views, and others advocating various forms of extreme anti-Christian sentiment, Satanism, or ethnic paganism. 
    In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murders. 
    There is also a small neo-Nazi movement within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists.
    Generally, black metal strives to remain an underground phenomenon.
